Changelog for AutoPatch
=======================

Version 1.0.1
-------------
- All development (bug tracking, feature requests, CVS, mailing lists)
  are hosted on sourceforge now, not just the releases. Check it out:
  http://autopatch.sourceforge.net
  
- Added support for Microsoft SQL Server dialect.
  Support for Microsoft SQL Server should be considered beta
  and some features may depend on specific JDBC drivers to
  work. The free MS-SQL JDBC driver may have issues.
  Basic DDL patches appear to work.

  Thank you Shirish Kulkarni
  
- Added support for Sybase dialect
  Support for Sybase should be considered beta at the moment.
  It has not received a great deal of testing yet.

  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- List of unapplied patches displayed prior to patching

- Read-only mode implemented, now you can specify that the
  system should be read-only, and it will do everything
  *except* actually apply the patches. If the level isn't correct
  it will throw an exception, you can use this to enforce consistency
  while making sure that systems aren't patched automatically
  (useful in production configurations)

- Added an example project that demonstrates how most of the AutoPatch
  features work, including the distributed feature
  Thank you Alex Soto
