Changelog for AutoPatch
=======================

Version HEAD <CHANGE UPON RELEASE>
----------------------------------
- Example configuration for mssql / ant from Simon Kingaby. Thanks Simon!

- Exposed the MigrationListener framework to allow user defined 
  MigrationListeners.  Define a property named <systemname>.listeners in your 
  migration.properties.  It supports a comma separated list of fully qualified
  java classnames that implement the MigrationListener interface.
  Thanks to Alex Soto <Alex @ Tacit Knowledge || apsoto @ gmail>
  
- Added the detection of new database nodes in a DistributedMigration.
  Default behaviour is to exit the patch process if a new node is detected.
  The node can be forcibly synced to the current patch level by defining a
  system property named 'forcesync'. See javadoc on DistributedMigrationProcess
  for more details.
  Thanks to Alex Soto <Alex @ Tacit Knowledge || apsoto @ gmail>
  
- Added support to DistributedStandaloneMigrationLauncher for specifying an 
  alternate migration.properties filename via the system property 
  'migration.settings'.  This brings the distributed migration feature
  in line with StandaloneMigrationLauncher which already supported this.
  Thanks to Natalia Usmanova @ KodakGallery dot Com  
  
- Added the ability to override the properties specified in the
  databasetype.properties (mysql.properties, hsqldb.properties, ...).
  Although technically possible to override any property in those files,
  the feature was added to tweak the *supportsMultipleStatements* property,
  and is probably the most common one to override.
  See the javadoc on com.tacitknowledge.util.migration.jdbc.DatabaseType
  for details on how to specify the override.
  Thanks to Alex Soto <Alex @ Tacit Knowledge || apsoto @ gmail>

- Added support for raw .sql patches in the PHP AutoPatch
  Thanks to Mike Hardy @ Tacit Knowledge
  
- Fixed a bug in the handling of the readOnly flag that caused it not to work!
  Bug found and correct patch proposed by Natalia Usmanova. Thanks Natalia!

Version 1.0.3
-------------
- Added "lockPollRetries" property, allows a configuration where AutoPatch
  will wait a maximum amount of time then override a lock. Also shored up
  testing / coverage in this area
  Thanks to Mike Hardy @ Tacit Knowledge

Version 1.0.2
-------------
- For standalone migration information and launcher added a possibility
  to supply a migration.settings system property (or command line argument)
  that will specify the name of the file to use for migration settings. If
  not supplied then the default 'migration.properties' will be used.  
  Thanks to Vladislav Gangan @ Tacit Knowledge

Version 1.0.1
-------------
- All development (bug tracking, feature requests, CVS, mailing lists)
  are hosted on sourceforge now, not just the releases. Check it out:
  http://autopatch.sourceforge.net
  
- Added support for Microsoft SQL Server dialect.
  Support for Microsoft SQL Server should be considered beta
  and some features may depend on specific JDBC drivers to
  work. The free MS-SQL JDBC driver may have issues.
  Basic DDL patches appear to work.

  Thank you Shirish Kulkarni
  
- Added support for Sybase dialect
  Support for Sybase should be considered beta at the moment.
  It has not received a great deal of testing yet.
  https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1662010
  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- List of unapplied patches displayed prior to patching

- Read-only mode implemented, now you can specify that the
  system should be read-only, and it will do everything
  *except* actually apply the patches. If the level isn't correct
  it will throw an exception, you can use this to enforce consistency
  while making sure that systems aren't patched automatically
  (useful in production configurations)

- Added an example project that demonstrates how most of the AutoPatch
  features work, including the distributed feature
  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- Found and fixed improper database connection usage
  https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1665584
  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- Implemented serial application of same patch across multiple
  databases, and extended documentation and example to cover this.
  This is referred to as "multi-node" patch application in the code and docs

  https://sourceforge.net/support/tracker.php?aid=1661985
  
- Added integration tests utilizing HSQLDB to further automate correctness
  Mike Hardy

- Implemented forcible table unlocking (useful if JVMs crash)

- Big Checkstyle cleanup

- Added XML file loader (useful to import DbUnit files)
  Alex Soto
  
- More friendly distribution packaging - a zip file, 
  and unpacks into a sub-directory instead of the current directory
  Mike Hardy
  
- Don't allow commit or rollback statements through to the connection
  if autocommit is true, JBoss will throw an exception otherwise
  Reported by Kendall Jackman @ ATG (thanks Kendall)
