Changelog for AutoPatch
=======================

Version 1.0.1
-------------
- All development (bug tracking, feature requests, CVS, mailing lists)
  are hosted on sourceforge now, not just the releases. Check it out:
  http://autopatch.sourceforge.net
  
- Added support for Microsoft SQL Server dialect.
  Support for Microsoft SQL Server should be considered beta
  and some features may depend on specific JDBC drivers to
  work. The free MS-SQL JDBC driver may have issues.
  Basic DDL patches appear to work.

  Thank you Shirish Kulkarni
  
- Added support for Sybase dialect
  Support for Sybase should be considered beta at the moment.
  It has not received a great deal of testing yet.

  Thank you Alex Soto

- Read-only mode implemented, now you can specify that the
  system should be read-only, and it will do everything
  *except* actually apply the patches. If the level isn't correct
  it will throw an exception, you can use this to enforce consistency
  while making sure that systems aren't patched automatically
  (useful in production configurations)

- Added an example project that demonstrates how most of the AutoPatch
  features work, including the distributed feature
  Thank you Alex Soto

  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- Implemented serial application of same patch across multiple
  databases, and extended documentation and example to cover this.
  This is referred to as "multi-node" patch application in the code and docs

- Big Checkstyle cleanup

- Added XML file loader (useful to import DbUnit files)

- More friendly distribution packaging - a zip file, 
  and unpacks into a sub-directory instead of the current directory
  Mike Hardy
  
- Don't allow commit or rollback statements through to the connection
  if autocommit is true, JBoss will throw an exception otherwise
