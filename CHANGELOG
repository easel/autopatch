Changelog for AutoPatch
=======================

Version HEAD <CHANGE UPON RELEASE>
----------------------------------
- Added the ability to override the properties specified in the
  databasetype.properties (mysql.properties, hsqldb.properties, ...).
  Although technically possible to override any property in those files,
  the feature was added to tweak the *supportsMultipleStatements* property,
  and is probably the most common one to override.
  See the javadoc on com.tacitknowledge.util.migration.jdbc.DatabaseType
  for details on how to specify the override.
  Thanks to Alex Soto <Alex @ Tacit Knowledge || apsoto @ gmail>

Version 1.0.3
-------------
- Added "lockPollRetries" property, allows a configuration where AutoPatch
  will wait a maximum amount of time then override a lock. Also shored up
  testing / coverage in this area
  Thanks to Mike Hardy @ Tacit Knowledge

Version 1.0.2
-------------
- For standalone migration information and launcher added a possibility
  to supply a migration.settings system property (or command line argument)
  that will specify the name of the file to use for migration settings. If
  not supplied then the default 'migration.properties' will be used.  
  Thanks to Vladislav Gangan @ Tacit Knowledge

Version 1.0.1
-------------
- All development (bug tracking, feature requests, CVS, mailing lists)
  are hosted on sourceforge now, not just the releases. Check it out:
  http://autopatch.sourceforge.net
  
- Added support for Microsoft SQL Server dialect.
  Support for Microsoft SQL Server should be considered beta
  and some features may depend on specific JDBC drivers to
  work. The free MS-SQL JDBC driver may have issues.
  Basic DDL patches appear to work.

- Added support for Sybase dialect
  Support for Sybase should be considered beta at the moment.
  It has not received a great deal of testing yet.

  Thank you Alex Soto

- Read-only mode implemented, now you can specify that the
  system should be read-only, and it will do everything
  *except* actually apply the patches. If the level isn't correct
  it will throw an exception, you can use this to enforce consistency
  while making sure that systems aren't patched automatically
  (useful in production configurations)

- Added an example project that demonstrates how most of the AutoPatch
  features work, including the distributed feature
  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- Found and fixed improper database connection usage

  Thank you Alex Soto
  
- Implemented serial application of same patch across multiple
  databases, and extended documentation and example to cover this.
  This is referred to as "multi-node" patch application in the code and docs

- Big Checkstyle cleanup

- Added XML file loader (useful to import DbUnit files)

- More friendly distribution packaging - a zip file, 
  and unpacks into a sub-directory instead of the current directory
  Mike Hardy
  
- Don't allow commit or rollback statements through to the connection
  if autocommit is true, JBoss will throw an exception otherwise
