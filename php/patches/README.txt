You should put your patches in this directory.
Files should contain valid PHP that executes a patch.
Files should have names like 'patchNNN_<patch_name>.php' - e.g. 'patch001_create_initial_tables.php'
A sample patch has been included, but note that it is *not* named correctly, so it will not execute - it is an example.
